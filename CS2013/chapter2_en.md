# Chapter 2: Principles

Early in its work, the 2013 Steering Committee agreed on a set of principles to guide the 
development of this volume. The principles adopted for CS2013 overlap significantly with the 
principles adopted for previous curricular efforts, most notably CC2001 and CS2008. As with 
previous ACM/IEEE curricula volumes, there are a variety of constituencies for CS2013, 
including individual faculty members and instructors at a wide range of colleges, universities, 
and technical schools on any of six continents; CS programs and the departments, colleges, and 
institutions housing them; accreditation and certification boards; authors; and researchers. Other 
constituencies include pre-college preparatory schools and advanced placement curricula as well 
as graduate programs in computer science. These principles were developed in consideration of 
these constituencies, as well as consideration of issues related to student outcomes, development 
of curricula, and the review process. The order of presentation is not intended to imply relative 
importance.

1. Computer science curricula should be designed to provide students with the flexibility to 
work across many disciplines. Computing is a broad field that connects to and draws from 
many disciplines, including mathematics, electrical engineering, psychology, statistics, fine 
arts, linguistics, and physical and life sciences. Computer Science students should develop 
the flexibility to work across disciplines.

2. Computer science curricula should be designed to prepare graduates for a variety of 
professions, attracting the full range of talent to the field. Computer science impacts nearly 
every modern endeavor. CS2013 takes a broad view of the field that includes topics such as 
“computational-x” (e.g., computational finance or computational chemistry) and “xinformatics” (e.g., eco-informatics or bio-informatics). Well-rounded CS graduates will have 
a balance of theory and application, as described in Chapter 3: Characteristics of Graduates.

3. CS2013 should provide guidance for the expected level of mastery of topics by graduates. It 
should suggest outcomes indicating the intended level of mastery and provide exemplars of 
instantiated courses and curricula that cover topics in the Body of Knowledge.

4. CS2013 must provide realistic, adoptable recommendations that provide guidance and 
flexibility, allowing curricular designs that are innovative and track recent developments in 
the field. The guidelines are intended to provide clear, implementable goals, while also 
providing the flexibility that programs need in order to respond to a rapidly changing field. 
CS2013 is intended as guidance, not as a minimal standard against which to evaluate a 
program.

5. The CS2013 guidelines must be relevant to a variety of institutions. Given the wide range of 
institutions and programs (including 2-year, 3-year, and 4-year programs; liberal arts, 
technological, and research institutions; and institutions of every size), it is neither possible 
nor desirable for these guidelines to dictate curricula for computing. Individual programs will 
need to evaluate their constraints and environments to construct curricula.

6. The size of the essential knowledge must be managed. While the range of relevant topics has 
expanded, the size of undergraduate education has not. Thus, CS2013 must carefully choose 
among topics and recommend the essential elements.

7. Computer science curricula should be designed to prepare graduates to succeed in a rapidly 
changing field. Computer Science is rapidly changing and will continue to change for the 
foreseeable future. Curricula must prepare students for lifelong learning and must include 
professional practice (e.g., communication skills, teamwork, ethics) as components of the 
undergraduate experience. Computer science students must learn to integrate theory and 
practice, to recognize the importance of abstraction, and to appreciate the value of good 
engineering design.

8. CS2013 should identify the fundamental skills and knowledge that all computer science 
graduates should possess while providing the greatest flexibility in selecting topics. To this 
end, we have introduced three levels of knowledge description: Tier-1 Core, Tier-2 Core, and 
Elective. For a full discussion of Tier-1 Core, Tier-2 Core, and Elective, see Chapter 4: 
Introduction to the Body of Knowledge.

9. CS2013 should provide the greatest flexibility in organizing topics into courses and 
curricula. Knowledge areas are not intended to describe specific courses. There are many
novel, interesting, and effective ways to combine topics from the Body of Knowledge into 
courses.

10. The development and review of CS2013 must be broadly based. The CS2013 effort must 
include participation from many different constituencies including industry, government, and 
the full range of higher education institutions involved in computer science education. It must 
take into account relevant feedback from these constituencies.
