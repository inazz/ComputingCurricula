# Chapter 4: Introduction to the Body of Knowledge

This chapter provides an introduction to the structure and rationale for the Body of Knowledge. 
It further describes the most substantial innovations in the Body of Knowledge. It does not 
propose a particular set of courses or curriculum structure -- that is the role of the course and 
curriculum exemplars. Rather, this chapter emphasizes the flexibility that the Body of 
Knowledge allows in adapting curricula to institutional needs and the continual evolution of the 
field. In Computer Science terms, one can view the Body of Knowledge as a specification of the 
content to be covered and a curriculum as an implementation. A large variety of curricula can 
meet the specification.

The following points are elaborated:

* Knowledge Areas are not intended to be in one-to-one correspondence with particular 
courses in a curriculum: We expect curricula will have courses that incorporate topics 
from multiple Knowledge Areas.

* Topics are identified as either “Core” or “Elective” with the core further subdivided into 
“Tier-1” and “Tier-2.”
 * A curriculum should include all topics in the Tier-1 core and ensure that all 
students cover this material.
 * A curriculum should include all or almost all topics in the Tier-2 core and ensure 
that all students encounter the vast majority of this material.
 * A curriculum should include significant elective material: Covering only “Core” 
topics is insufficient for a complete curriculum.

* Because it is a hierarchical outline, the Body of Knowledge under-emphasizes some key
issues that must be considered when constructing a curriculum, such as the ways in which 
a curriculum allows students to develop the characteristics outlined in Chapter 3: 
Characteristics of Graduates. 

* The learning outcomes and hour counts in the Body of Knowledge provide guidance on 
the depth of coverage towards which curricula should aim.

* There are several new Knowledge Areas that reflect important changes in the field.


## Knowledge Areas are Not Necessarily Courses (and Important Examples Thereof)

It is naturally tempting to associate each Knowledge Area with a course. We explicitly 
discourage this practice in general, even though many curricula will have some courses 
containing material from only one Knowledge Area or, conversely, all the material from one 
Knowledge Area in one course. We view the hierarchical structure of the Body of Knowledge as 
a useful way to group related information, not as a stricture for organizing material into courses. 
Beyond this general flexibility, in several places we expect many curricula to integrate material 
from multiple Knowledge Areas, in particular:

* Introductory courses: There are diverse successful approaches to introductory courses in 
computer science. Many focus on the topics in Software Development Fundamentals 
together with a subset of the topics in Programming Languages or Software Engineering, 
while leaving most of the topics in these other Knowledge Areas to advanced courses. 
But which topics from other Knowledge Areas are covered in introductory courses can 
vary. Some courses use object-oriented programming; others, functional programming; 
and others, platform-based development (thereby covering topics in the Platform-Based 
Development Knowledge Area). Conversely, there is no requirement that all Software 
Development Fundamentals be covered in a first or second course, though in practice 
most topics will usually be covered in these early courses. A separate chapter discusses 
introductory courses more generally.

* Systems courses: The topics in the Systems Fundamentals Knowledge Area can be 
presented in courses designed to cover general systems principles or in those devoted to 
particular systems areas such as computer architecture, operating systems, networking, or 
distributed systems. For example, an Operating Systems course might be designed to 
cover more general systems principles, such as low-level programming, concurrency and
synchronization, performance measurement, or computer security, in addition to topics 
more specifically related to operating systems. Consequently, such courses will likely 
draw on material in several Knowledge Areas. Certain fundamental systems topics like 
latency or parallelism will likely arise in many places in a curriculum. While it is 
important that such topics do arise, preferably in multiple settings, the Body of 
Knowledge does not specify the particular settings in which to teach such topics. The 
course exemplars in Appendix C show multiple ways that such material may be 
organized into courses.

* Parallel computing: Among the changes to the Body of Knowledge from previous 
reports is a new Knowledge Area in Parallel and Distributed Computing. An alternative 
structure for the Body of Knowledge would place relevant topics in other Knowledge 
Areas: parallel algorithms with algorithms, programming constructs in softwaredevelopment focused areas, multi-core design with computer architecture, and so forth. 
We chose instead to provide guidance on the essential parallelism topics in one place. 
Some, but not all, curricula will likely have courses dedicated to parallelism, at least in 
the near term.

## Core Tier-1, Core Tier-2, Elective: What These Terms Mean, What is Required

As described at the beginning of this chapter, computer-science curricula should cover all the 
Core Tier-1 topics, all or almost all of the Core Tier-2 topics, and significant depth in many of 
the Elective topics (i.e., the core is not sufficient for an undergraduate degree in computer 
science). Here we provide additional perspective on what “Core Tier-1,” “Core Tier-2”, and 
“Elective” mean, including motivation for these distinctions.

**Motivation for subdividing the core:** Earlier curricular guidelines had only “Core” and 
“Elective” with every topic in the former being required. We departed from this strict 
interpretation of “everything in the core must be taught to every student” for these reasons:

* Many strong computer-science curricula were missing at least one hour of core material. 
It is misleading to suggest that such curricula are outside the definition of an 
undergraduate degree in computer science.

* As the field has grown, there is ever-increasing pressure to grow the core and to allow 
students to specialize in areas of interest. Doing so simply becomes impossible within 
the short time-frame of an undergraduate degree. Providing some flexibility on coverage 
of core topics enables curricula and students to specialize if they choose to do so.

Conversely, we could have allowed for any core topic to be skipped provided that the vast 
majority was part of every student’s education. By retaining a smaller Core Tier-1 of required 
material, we provide additional guidance and structure for curriculum designers. In the Core 
Tier-1 are the topics that are fundamental to the structure of any computer-science program.

**On the meaning of Core Tier-1:** A Core Tier-1 topic should be a required part of every
Computer Science curriculum. While Core Tier-2 and Elective topics are important, the Core 
Tier-1 topics are those with widespread consensus for inclusion in every program. While most 
Core Tier-1 topics will typically be covered in introductory courses, others may be covered in 
later courses.

**On the meaning of Core Tier-2:** Core Tier-2 topics are generally essential in an 
undergraduate computer-science degree. Requiring the vast majority of them is a minimum
expectation, and if a program prefers to cover all of the Core Tier-2 topics, we encourage them to 
do so. That said, Computer Science programs can allow students to focus in certain areas in 
which some Core Tier-2 topics are not required. We also acknowledge that resource constraints, 
such as a small number of faculty or institutional limits on degree requirements, may make it 
prohibitively difficult to cover every topic in the core while still providing advanced elective 
material. **A computer-science curriculum should aim to cover 90-100% of the Core Tier-2 
topics, with 80% considered a minimum.**

There is no expectation that Core Tier-1 topics necessarily precede all Core Tier-2 topics in a 
curriculum. In particular, we expect introductory courses will draw on both Core Tier-1 and
Core Tier-2 (and possibly elective) material and that some core material will be delayed until 
later courses.

**On the meaning of Elective:** A program covering only core material would provide 
insufficient breadth and depth in computer science. Most programs will not cover all the elective 
material in the Body of Knowledge and certainly few, if any, students will cover all of it within 
an undergraduate program. Conversely, the Body of Knowledge is by no means exhaustive, and 
advanced courses may often go beyond the topics and learning outcomes contained in it. 
Nonetheless, the Body of Knowledge provides a useful guide on material appropriate for a 
computer-science undergraduate degree, and all students of computer science should deepen 
their understanding in multiple areas via the elective topics. 

A curriculum may well require material designated elective in the Body of Knowledge. Many 
curricula, especially those with a particular focus, will require some elective topics, by virtue of 
them being covered in required courses.

**The size of the core:** The size of the core (Tier-1 plus Tier-2) is a few hours larger than in 
previous curricular guidelines, but this is counterbalanced by our more flexible treatment of the 
core. As a result, we are not increasing the number of required courses a curriculum should 
need. Indeed, a curriculum covering 90% of the Tier-2 hours would have the same number of 
core hours as a curriculum covering the core in the CS2008 volume, and a curriculum covering 
80% of the Tier-2 hours would have fewer core hours than even a curriculum covering the core 
in the CC2001 volume (the core grew from 2001 to 2008). A more thorough quantitative 
comparison is presented at the end of this chapter.

**A note on balance:** Computer Science is an elegant interplay of theory, software, hardware, 
and applications. The core in general and Tier-1 in particular, when viewed in isolation, may 
seem to focus on programming, discrete structures, and algorithms. This focus results from the 
fact that these topics typically come early in a curriculum so that advanced courses can use them 
as prerequisites. Essential experience with systems and applications can be achieved in more 
disparate ways using elective material in the Body of Knowledge. Because all curricula will
include appropriate elective material, an overall curriculum can and should achieve an 
appropriate balance.

## Further Considerations in Designing a Curriculum
As useful as the Body of Knowledge is, it is important to complement it with a thoughtful 
understanding of cross-cutting themes in a curriculum, the “big ideas” of computer science. In 
designing a curriculum, it is also valuable to identify curriculum-wide objectives, for which the 
Principles and the Characteristics of Graduates chapters of this volume should prove useful. 

In the last few years, two on-going trends have had deep effects on many curricula. First, the 
continuing growth of computer science has led to many programs organizing their curricula to 
allow for intradisciplinary specialization (using terms such as threads, tracks, and vectors). 
Second, the importance of computing to almost every other field has increasingly led to the 
creation of interdisciplinary programs (e.g., joint majors and double majors) and incorporating 
interdisciplinary material into computer-science programs. We applaud both trends and believe 
a flexible Body of Knowledge, including a flexible core, supports them. Conversely, such 
specialization is not required: Many programs will continue to offer a broad yet thorough 
coverage of computer science as a distinct and coherent discipline.

## Organization of the Body of Knowledge
The CS2013 Body of Knowledge is presented as a set of Knowledge Areas (KAs), organized on 
topical themes rather than by course boundaries. Each KA is further organized into a set of 
Knowledge Units (KUs), which are summarized in a table at the head of each KA section. We 
expect that the topics within the KAs will be organized into courses in different ways at different 
institutions.

## Curricular Hours
Continuing in the tradition of CC2001/CS2008, we define the unit of coverage in the Body of 
Knowledge in terms of **lecture hours**, as being the sole unit that is understandable in (and 
transferable to) cross-cultural contexts. An “hour” corresponds to the time required to present the
material in a traditional lecture-oriented format; the hour count does not include any additional 
work that is associated with a lecture (e.g., in self-study, laboratory sessions, and assessments). 
 Indeed, we expect students to spend a significant amount of additional time outside of class 
developing facility with the material presented in class. As with previous reports, we maintain 
the principle that the use of a lecture-hour as the unit of measurement does not require or endorse 
the use of traditional lectures for the presentation of material.

The specification of topic hours represents the minimum amount of time we expect such 
coverage to take. Any institution may opt to cover the same material in a longer period of time as 
warranted by the individual needs of that institution.

## Courses
Throughout the Body of Knowledge, when we refer to a “course” we mean an institutionallyrecognized unit of study. Depending on local circumstance, full-time students will take several 
“courses” at any one time, typically several per academic year. While “course” is a common 
term at some institutions, others will use other names, for example “module” or “paper.”

## Guidance on Learning Outcomes
Each KU within a KA lists both a set of topics and the learning outcomes students are expected 
to achieve with respect to the topics specified. Learning outcomes are not of equal size and do 
not have a uniform mapping to curriculum hours; topics with the same number of hours may 
have quite different numbers of associated learning outcomes. Each learning outcome has an 
associated level of mastery. In defining different levels we drew from other curriculum 
approaches, especially Bloom’s Taxonomy, which has been well explored within computer 
science. We did not directly apply Bloom’s levels in part because several of them are driven by 
pedagogic context, which would introduce too much plurality in a document of this kind; in part 
because we intend the mastery levels to be indicative and not to impose theoretical constraint on 
users of this document. 

We use three levels of mastery, defined as:
* **Familiarity:** The student understands what a concept is or what it means. This level of 
mastery concerns a basic awareness of a concept as opposed to expecting real facility 
with its application. It provides an answer to the question “What do you know about 
this?”
* **Usage:** The student is able to use or apply a concept in a concrete way. Using a concept 
may include, for example, appropriately using a specific concept in a program, using a 
particular proof technique, or performing a particular analysis. It provides an answer to 
the question “What do you know how to do?”
* **Assessment:** The student is able to consider a concept from multiple viewpoints and/or 
justify the selection of a particular approach to solve a problem. This level of mastery 
implies more than using a concept; it involves the ability to select an appropriate 
approach from understood alternatives. It provides an answer to the question “Why 
would you do that?”
As a concrete, although admittedly simplistic, example of these levels of mastery, we consider 
the notion of iteration in software development, for example for-loops, while-loops, and iterators. 
At the level of “Familiarity,” a student would be expected to have a definition of the concept of 
iteration in software development and know why it is a useful technique. In order to show 
mastery at the “Usage” level, a student should be able to write a program properly using a form 
of iteration. Understanding iteration at the “Assessment” level would require a student to 
understand multiple methods for iteration and be able to appropriately select among them for 
different applications.

The descriptions we have included for learning outcomes may not exactly match those used by 
institutions, in either specifics or emphasis. Institutions may have different learning outcomes 
that capture the same level of mastery and intent for a given topic. Nevertheless, we believe that 
by giving descriptive learning outcomes, we both make our intention clear and facilitate 
interpretation of what outcomes mean in the context of a particular curriculum.

## Overview of New Knowledge Areas
While computer science encompasses technologies that change rapidly over time, it is defined by 
essential concepts, perspectives, and methodologies that are constant. As a result, much of the
core Body of Knowledge remains unchanged from earlier curricular volumes. However, new 
developments in computing technology and pedagogy mean that some aspects of the core evolve 
over time, and some of the previous structures and organization may no longer be appropriate for 
describing the discipline. As a result, CS2013 has modified the organization of the Body of 
Knowledge in various ways, adding some new KAs and restructuring others. We highlight these 
changes in the remainder of this section.

### Information Assurance and Security (IAS)
IAS is a new KA in recognition of the world’s critical reliance on information technology and 
computing. IAS as a domain is the set of controls and processes, both technical and policy, 
intended to protect and defend information and information systems. IAS draws together topics 
that are pervasive throughout other KAs. Topics germane to only IAS are presented in depth in 
this KA, whereas other topics are noted and cross referenced to the KAs that contain them. As 
such, this KA is prefaced with a detailed table of cross-references to other KAs.

### Networking and Communication (NC)
CC2001 introduced a KA entitled “Net-Centric Computing”, which encompassed a combination 
of topics including traditional networking, web development, and network security. Given the 
growth and divergence in these topics since the last report, we renamed and re-factored this KA 
to focus specifically on topics in networking and communication. Discussions of web 
applications and mobile device development are now covered in the new Platform-Based 
Development KA. Security is covered in the new Information Assurance and Security KA.

### Platform-Based Development (PBD)
PBD is a new KA that recognizes the increasing use of platform-specific programming 
environments, both at the introductory level and in upper-level electives. Platforms such as the 
Web or mobile devices enable students to learn within and about environments constrained by 
hardware, APIs, and special services (often in cross-disciplinary contexts). These environments 
are sufficiently different from “general purpose” programming to warrant this new (wholly 
elective) KA.

### Parallel and Distributed Computing (PD)
Previous curricular volumes had parallelism topics distributed across disparate KAs as electives. 
Given the vastly increased importance of parallel and distributed computing, it seemed crucial to 
identify essential concepts in this area and to promote those topics to the core. To highlight and 
coordinate this material, CS2013 dedicates a KA to this area. This new KA includes material on 
programming models, programming pragmatics, algorithms, performance, computer architecture, 
and distributed systems.

### Software Development Fundamentals (SDF)
This new KA generalizes introductory programming to focus on more of the software 
development process, identifying concepts and skills that should be mastered in the first year of a 
computer-science program. As a result of its broad purpose, the SDF KA includes fundamental 
concepts and skills that could appear in other software-oriented KAs (e.g., programming 
constructs from Programming Languages, simple algorithm analysis from Algorithms and 
Complexity, simple development methodologies from Software Engineering). Likewise, each of 
those KAs will contain more advanced material that builds upon the fundamental concepts and 
skills in SDF. Compared to previous volumes, key approaches to programming -- including 
object-oriented programming, functional programming, and event-driven programming -- are 
kept in one place, namely the Programming Languages KA, with an expectation that any 
curriculum will cover some of these topics in introductory courses.

### Systems Fundamentals (SF)
In previous curricular volumes, the interacting layers of a typical computing system, from 
hardware building blocks, to architectural organization, to operating system services, to 
application execution environments (particularly for parallel execution in a modern view of 
applications), were presented in independent knowledge areas. The new Systems Fundamentals 
KA presents a unified systems perspective and common conceptual foundation for other KAs 
(notably Architecture and Organization, Network and Communications, Operating Systems, and 
Parallel and Distributed Algorithms). An organizational principle is “programming for 
performance”: what a programmer needs to understand about the underlying system to achieve 
high performance, particularly in terms of exploiting parallelism.

## Core Hours in Knowledge Areas

An overview of the number of core hours (both Tier-1 and Tier-2) by KA in the CS2013 Body of 
Knowledge is provided below. For comparison, the number of core hours from both the 
previous CS2008 and CC2001 reports are provided as well.

</table>


As seen above, in CS2013 the total Tier-1 hours together with the entirety of Tier-2 hours 
slightly exceeds the total core hours from previous reports. However, it is important to note that 
the tiered structure of the core in CS2013 explicitly provides the flexibility for institutions to 
select topics from Tier-2 (to include at least 80%). As a result, it is possible to implement the 
CS2013 guidelines with comparable hours to previous curricular guidelines.
