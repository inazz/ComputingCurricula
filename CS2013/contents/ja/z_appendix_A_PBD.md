# プラットフォームに依存した開発 (PBD)

Platform-based development is concerned with the design and development of software
applications that reside on specific software platforms. In contrast to general purpose
programming, platform-based development takes into account platform-specific constraints. For
instance web programming, multimedia development, mobile computing, app development, and
robotics are examples of relevant platforms that provide specific services/APIs/hardware that
constrain development. Such platforms are characterized by the use of specialized APIs, distinct
delivery/update mechanisms, and being abstracted away from the machine level. Platform-based
development may be applied over a wide breadth of ecosystems.  

While we recognize that some platforms (e.g., web development) are prominent, we are also
cognizant of the fact that no particular platform should be specified as a requirement in the
CS2013 curricular guidelines. Consequently, this Knowledge Area highlights many of the
platforms that have become popular, without including any such platform in the core curriculum.
We note that the general skill of developing with respect to an API or a constrained environment
is covered in other Knowledge Areas, such as Software Development Fundamentals (SDF).
Platform-based development further emphasizes such general skills within the context of
particular platforms.
