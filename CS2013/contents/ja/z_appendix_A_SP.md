# 社会的視点と情報倫理 (SP)

While technical issues are central to the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete
educational program in the field. Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of
computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social, ethical, legal and professional
issues. This need to incorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM curriculum
was formally recognized in 1991, as can be seen from the following excerpt [^2]:

<blockquote>
Undergraduates also need to understand the basic cultural, social, legal, and ethical
issues inherent in the discipline of computing. They should understand where the
discipline has been, where it is, and where it is heading. They should also understand
their individual roles in this process, as well as appreciate the philosophical questions,
technical problems, and aesthetic values that play an important part in the development
of the discipline.

Students also need to develop the ability to ask serious questions about the social
impact of computing and to evaluate proposed answers to those questions. Future
practitioners must be able to anticipate the impact of introducing a given product into a
given environment. Will that product enhance or degrade the quality of life? What will
the impact be upon individuals, groups, and institutions?

Finally, students need to be aware of the basic legal rights of software and hardware
vendors and users, and they also need to appreciate the ethical values that are the basis
for those rights. Future practitioners must understand the responsibility that they will
bear, and the possible consequences of failure. They must understand their own
limitations as well as the limitations of their tools. All practitioners must make a longterm commitment to remaining current in their chosen specialties and in the discipline
of computing as a whole.
</blockquote>

As technological advances continue to significantly impact the way we live and work, the critical
importance of social issues and professional practice continues to increase; new computer-based
products and venues pose ever more challenging problems each year. It is our students who
must enter the workforce and academia with intentional regard for the identification and
resolution of these problems.

Computer science educators may opt to deliver this core and elective material in stand-alone
courses, integrated into traditional technical and theoretical courses, or as special units in
capstone and professional practice courses. The material in this familiarity area is best covered
through a combination of one required course along with short modules in other courses. On the
one hand, some units listed as Core Tier-1 (in particular, Social Context, Analytical Tools,
Professional Ethics, and Intellectual Property) do not readily lend themselves to being covered in
other traditional courses. Without a standalone course, it is difficult to cover these topics
appropriately. On the other hand, if ethical and social considerations are covered only in the
standalone course and not “in context,” it will reinforce the false notion that technical processes
are void of these other relevant issues. Because of this broad relevance, it is important that
several traditional courses include modules with case studies that analyze the ethical, legal,
social and professional considerations in the context of the technical subject matter of the course.
Courses in areas such as software engineering, databases, computer networks, information
assurance and security, and introduction to computing provide obvious context for analysis of
ethical issues. However, an ethics-related module could be developed for almost any course in
the curriculum. It would be explicitly against the spirit of the recommendations to have only a
standalone course. Running through all of the issues in this area is the need to speak to the
computing practitioner’s responsibility to proactively address these issues by both moral and
technical actions. The ethical issues discussed in any class should be directly related to and arise
naturally from the subject matter of that class. Examples include a discussion in the database
course of data aggregation or data mining, or a discussion in the software engineering course of
the potential conflicts between obligations to the customer and obligations to the user and others
affected by their work. Programming assignments built around applications such as controlling
the movement of a laser during eye surgery can help to address the professional, ethical and
social impacts of computing. Computing faculty who are unfamiliar with the content and/or
pedagogy of applied ethics are urged to take advantage of the considerable resources from ACM,
IEEE-CS, SIGCAS (special interest group on computers and society), and other organizations.

It should be noted that the application of ethical analysis underlies every subsection of this Social
and Professional knowledge area in computing. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional
Conduct (http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) provides guidelines that serve as the basis
for the conduct of our professional work. The General Moral Imperatives provide an
understanding of our commitment to personal responsibility, professional conduct, and our
leadership roles.

## SP/分析ツール
*[必修 2時間]*

Ethical theories and principles are the foundations of ethical analysis because they are the
viewpoints from which guidance can be obtained along the pathway to a decision. Each theory
emphasizes different points such as predicting the outcome and following one's duties to others
in order to reach an ethically guided decision. However, in order for an ethical theory to be
useful, the theory must be directed towards a common set of goals. Ethical principles are the
common goals that each theory tries to achieve in order to be successful. These goals include
beneficence, least harm, respect for autonomy, and justice.

## SP/知的財産権
*[必修 2時間]*

Intellectual property refers to a range of intangible rights of ownership in an asset such as a
software program. Each intellectual property "right" is itself an asset. The law provides different
methods for protecting these rights of ownership based on their type. There are essentially four
types of intellectual property rights relevant to software: patents, copyrights, trade secrets and
trademarks. Each affords a different type of legal protection. See cross-referencing with the
Information Management (IM) Knowledge Area.

## SP/プライバシーと市民的自由

Electronic information sharing highlights the need to balance privacy protections with
information access. The ease of digital access to many types of data makes privacy rights and
civil liberties more complex, differing among the variety of cultures worldwide. See crossreferencing with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Assurance and Security

## SP/専門家としてのコミュニケーション能力
*[必修 1時間]*

Professional communication conveys technical information to various audiences who may have
very different goals and needs for that information. Effective professional communication of
technical information is rarely an inherited gift, but rather needs to be taught in context
