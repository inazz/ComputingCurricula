# Chapter 3: Characteristics of Graduates

Graduates of computer science programs should have fundamental competency in the areas 
described by the Body of Knowledge (see Chapter 4), particularly the core topics contained 
there. However, there are also competences that graduates of CS programs should have that are 
not explicitly listed in the Body of Knowledge. Professionals in the field typically embody a 
characteristic style of thinking and problem solving, a style that emerges from the experiences 
obtained through study of the field and professional practice. Below, we describe the 
characteristics that we believe should be attained at least at an elementary level by graduates of 
computer science programs. These characteristics will enable their success in the field and 
further professional development. Some of these characteristics and skills also apply to other 
fields. They are included here because the development of these skills and characteristics should 
be explicitly addressed and encouraged by computer science programs. This list is based on a 
similar list in CC2001 and CS2008. The substantive changes that led to this new version were 
influenced by responses to a survey conducted by the CS2013 Steering Committee.

**At a broad level, the expected characteristics of computer science graduates include the 
following:**

### Technical understanding of computer science
Graduates should have a mastery of computer science as described by the core of the Body of 
Knowledge.

### Familiarity with common themes and principles 
Graduates need understanding of a number of recurring themes, such as abstraction, complexity, 
and evolutionary change, and a set of general principles, such as sharing a common resource, 
security, and concurrency. Graduates should recognize that these themes and principles have 
broad application to the field of computer science and should not consider them as relevant only 
to the domains in which they were introduced.

### Appreciation of the interplay between theory and practice 
A fundamental aspect of computer science is understanding the interplay between theory and 
practice and the essential links between them. Graduates of a computer science program need to 
understand how theory and practice influence each other.

### System-level perspective
Graduates of a computer science program need to think at multiple levels of detail and 
abstraction. This understanding should transcend the implementation details of the various 
components to encompass an appreciation for the structure of computer systems and the 
processes involved in their construction and analysis. They need to recognize the context in 
which a computer system may function, including its interactions with people and the physical 
world.

### Problem solving skills 
Graduates need to understand how to apply the knowledge they have gained to solve real 
problems, not just write code and move bits. They should to be able to design and improve a 
system based on a quantitative and qualitative assessment of its functionality, usability and 
performance. They should realize that there are multiple solutions to a given problem and that 
selecting among them is not a purely technical activity, as these solutions will have a real impact 
on peopleâ€™s lives. Graduates also should be able to communicate their solution to others, 
including why and how a solution solves the problem and what assumptions were made.

### Project experience
To ensure that graduates can successfully apply the knowledge they have gained, all graduates of 
computer science programs should have been involved in at least one substantial project. In most 
cases, this experience will be a software development project, but other experiences are also 
appropriate in particular circumstances. Such projects should challenge students by being 
integrative, requiring evaluation of potential solutions, and requiring work on a larger scale than 
typical course projects. Students should have opportunities to develop their interpersonal 
communication skills as part of their project experience. 

### Commitment to life-long learning 
Graduates should realize that the computing field advances at a rapid pace, and graduates must 
possess a solid foundation that allows and encourages them to maintain relevant skills as the
field evolves. Specific languages and technology platforms change over time. Therefore, 
graduates need to realize that they must continue to learn and adapt their skills throughout their 
careers. To develop this ability, students should be exposed to multiple programming languages, 
tools, paradigms, and technologies as well as the fundamental underlying principles throughout 
their education. In addition, graduates are now expected to manage their own career 
development and advancement. Graduates seeking career advancement often engage in 
professional development activities, such as certifications, management training, or obtaining 
domain-specific knowledge.

### Commitment to professional responsibility 
Graduates should recognize the social, legal, ethical, and cultural issues inherent in the discipline 
of computing. They must further recognize that social, legal, and ethical standards vary 
internationally. They should be knowledgeable about the interplay of ethical issues, technical 
problems, and aesthetic values that play an important part in the development of computing 
systems. Practitioners must understand their individual and collective responsibility and the 
possible consequences of failure. They must understand their own limitations as well as the 
limitations of their tools. 

### Communication and organizational skills 
Graduates should have the ability to make effective presentations to a range of audiences about 
technical problems and their solutions. This may involve face-to-face, written, or electronic 
communication. They should be prepared to work effectively as members of teams. Graduates 
should be able to manage their own learning and development, including managing time, 
priorities, and progress.

### Awareness of the broad applicability of computing 
Platforms range from embedded micro-sensors to high-performance clusters and distributed 
clouds. Computer applications impact nearly every aspect of modern life. Graduates should 
understand the full range of opportunities available in computing. 

### Appreciation of domain-specific knowledge 
Graduates should understand that computing interacts with many different domains. Solutions to 
many problems require both computing skills and domain knowledge. Therefore, graduates need 
to be able to communicate with, and learn from, experts from different domains throughout their 
careers.
