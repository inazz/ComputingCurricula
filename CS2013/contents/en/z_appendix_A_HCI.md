# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
Human-computer interaction (HCI) is concerned with designing interactions between human
activities and the computational systems that support them, and with constructing interfaces to
afford those interactions.

Interaction between users and computational artefacts occurs at an interface that includes both
software and hardware. Thus interface design impacts the software life-cycle in that it should
occur early; the design and implementation of core functionality can influence the user interface
– for better or worse.

Because it deals with people as well as computational systems, as a knowledge area HCI
demands the consideration of cultural, social, organizational, cognitive and perceptual issues.
Consequently it draws on a variety of disciplinary traditions, including psychology, ergonomics,
computer science, graphic and product design, anthropology and engineering.

## HCI/Foundations
*[4 Core-Tier1 hours]*

**Motivation:** For end-users, the interface is the system. So design in this domain must be
interaction-focused and human-centered. Students need a different repertoire of techniques to
address this than is provided elsewhere in the curriculum.

**Topics:**

* Contexts for HCI (anything with a user interface, e.g., webpage, business applications, mobile applications,
and games)
* Processes for user-centered development, e.g., early focus on users, empirical testing, iterative design
* Different measures for evaluation, e.g., utility, efficiency, learnability, user satisfaction
* Usability heuristics and the principles of usability testing
* Physical capabilities that inform interaction design, e.g., color perception, ergonomics
* Cognitive models that inform interaction design, e.g., attention, perception and recognition, movement, and
memory; gulfs of expectation and execution
* Social models that inform interaction design, e.g., culture, communication, networks and organizations
* Principles of good design and good designers; engineering tradeoffs
* Accessibility, e.g., interfaces for differently-abled populations (e.g., blind, motion-impaired)
* Interfaces for differently-aged population groups (e.g., children, 80+)

developer or their acquaintances. [Usage]
5. Create and conduct a simple usability test for an existing software application. [Assessment]
